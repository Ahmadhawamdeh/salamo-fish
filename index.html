                <h2>Cookies history</h2>
                <p>Cookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented, in part because they deal
                    with travel very well, but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern
                    standards.

                    Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar
                    became relatively common in the region. They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain.
                    By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society throughout Europe, from royal cuisine
                    to street vendors.[citation needed]

                    With global travel becoming widespread at that time, cookies made a natural travel companion,
                    a modernized equivalent of the travel cakes used throughout history. One of the most popular
                    early cookies, which traveled especially well and became known on every continent by similar names,
                    was the jumble, a relatively hard cookie made largely from nuts, sweetener, and water.

                    Cookies came to America through the Dutch in New Amsterdam in the late 1620s. The Dutch word
                    "koekje" was Anglicized to "cookie" or cooky. The earliest reference to cookies in America is
                    in 1703, when "The Dutch in New York provided...'in 1703...at a funeral 800 cookies...

                    The most common modern cookie, given its style by the creaming of butter and sugar,
                    was not common until the 18th century. Cookies may be "dunked" into a drink,
                    especially tea, coffee, or milk, an approach which releases more flavour from confections by
                    dissolving the sugars, while also softening their texture. Dunking can be used to melt
                    chocolate on biscuits to create a richer flavour.
